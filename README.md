# pie-lab.at

Website for Playful Interactive Environments at <https://pie-lab.at>

## Notes on the Setup

\_sass and \_js are containing the source files. The `css` and `js` folders and their content are only held in this repository to provide them for gh-pages. These tasks aren’t included in the Jekyll build itself, so setting up a development machine is recommended. See the instructions for Windows and Mac OS X below.

## Development on Windows

These are the full development instructions to get a development machine running under Microsoft Windows.

### Install Git and Clone the Repository

Get the Git binaries from <https://git-scm.com/> or download GitHub Desktop from <https://desktop.github.com/>, then clone the repository to your local machine (e.g., `C:\Users\[User]\Documents\GitHub\pie-lab.at`).

### Install Ruby

Go to <http://rubyinstaller.org/>, download the latest installer for Ruby and run it.

### Install Bundler and Jekyll

Once Ruby is installed, install Jekyll and its necessary plugins using [Bundler](https://bundler.io/). First, install the Bundler gem: `gem install bundler`. Then install the gems listed in the Gemfile by calling `bundle install`. 

For further details, see <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/>.

### Install Node.js

To be able to compile SASS (and other things), Node.js needs to be installed. Go to <https://nodejs.org/> and download the latest stable version and install it. Mature and stable (usually older) is not required.

### Install the Dependencies for the Build Process

First, install the Gulp.js CLI globally: `npm install gulp-cli -g`.
Open a Terminal window and go to the directory where you cloned the repository (e.g., `C:\Users\[User]\Documents\GitHub\pie-lab.at`). Type in `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

### Start the Build System

The build workflow uses gulp. To start the server an all necessary tools, open a “Node.js command prompt” window, navigate to the cloned repository and enter `gulp dev`. This should start everything, including your Jekyll server. To access the website go to <http://localhost:4000/>. 

## Development on Mac OS X

These are the full development instructions to get a development machine running under Mac OS X.

### Install Git and Clone the Repository

Get the Git binaries from <https://git-scm.com/> or download GitHub Desktop from <https://desktop.github.com/>, then clone the repository to your local machine (e.g., `/Documents/GitHub/pie-lab.at`).

### Install Ruby

Use the Ruby Version Manager (RVM) to get the latest Ruby version installed. Go to <https://rvm.io/> and follow the installation instructions on the front page. Provide the flag `--ruby` to install ruby together with RVM in one go.

### Install Bundler and Jekyll

Once Ruby is installed, install Jekyll and its necessary plugins with the help of Bundler. First, install the Bundler gem: `gem install bundler`. Then install the gems listed in the Gemfile by calling `bundle install`.

For further details, see <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/>.

To be able to compile SASS (and other things), Node.js needs to be installed. Go to <https://nodejs.org/> and download the latest stable version and install it. Mature and stable (usually older) is not required.

The build workflow uses gulp. To start the server an all necessary tools, open a Terminal window, navigate to the cloned repository and enter `gulp dev`. This should start everything, including your Jekyll server. To access the website go to <http://localhost:4000/>. 

## Available Gulp Tasks

* `gulp dev`: Development mode that watches the directory for changes.
* `gulp build`: Build mode, which creates a current build of the website in the `_site` directory.
* `gulp test`: Test mode that only runs eslint and stylelint to check for errors.

## Updating Dependencies

The packages used throughout the site are from the Ruby (gem) and Node.js (npm) ecosystems. They need to be updated separately.

## Update Ruby Dependencies

To update all Ruby gems involved, run `bundle update`. To remove (now unused) older versions, type `gem cleanup`.

## Update Node.js Dependencies

To update all Node.js modules involved, run `npm update`.

To go a step further and upgrade all dependencies in `package.json` to their latest available versions, use `npm-check-updates -u` (install first if not available: `npm install -g npm-check-updates`). This will create an updated `package.json`. Make sure that the previous version is stored in version control since npm-check-updates will overwrite it.
