The Expanded Animation Symposium is an annual event organized by the Hagenberg Campus of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria and Ars Electronica. The symposium has been part of the Ars Electronica Festival since 2013. Based on the early discussions at the media festival and in conjunction with the Prix Ars Electronica’s category Computer Animation, the symposium tackles animation at the intersection of art, technology, and society. The symposium serves as a hybrid between practice and theory and features talks, panel discussions, workshops, and artist presentations at various venues.

The Expanded Animation Symposium has continually examined the vast and constantly evolving field of animation and its myriad connections to other disciplines. Along this journey, the symposium has featured prominent and upcoming people, projects and perspectives that have significantly shaped the current animation landscape. In addition to becoming a regular part of the Ars Electronica Festival, the symposium has continued to expand. It was developed from an initial one-day event to a three-day affair that includes multiple tracks, exhibitions, performances and even an additional symposium, Synaesthetic Syntax, organized in collaboration with the University for Creative Arts, Farnham.
